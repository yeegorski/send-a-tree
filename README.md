## send-a-tree
This is a project completed as a part of Data36 Junior Data Scientist course.

The course is centered around a hypothetical start-up called "Send a Tree." It is an online application that has only one feature at the moment - sending digital trees to friends. There is a paid feature in the application - sending a super tree to a friend that costs $1 (the first super tree is free).

I have to analyse the data and conclude if the business would generate profit (if people would pay for sending super trees.)

Additional information:
  The data tracking started 5 months before the start of the data science project.
  As of the day of the project start, there were 1800+ new registrations daily and 16000+ tree-sends daily
